      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I've taken five years of programming classes, and even though I'm a little rusty, I recently rediscovered my appreciation for it. I figured if I was gonna sit around the house for the next year or so I might was well do something productive with my time.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Pennsylvania, then moved to Virginia my senior year of high school. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am an avid creative writer, Dungeon Master, reader, and gamer. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Creative Director always had a nice ring to it ;)</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Honestly? The money. As much as I enjoy web development, if it didn't pay as well as it does it wouldn't be worth the frustration.</p>
